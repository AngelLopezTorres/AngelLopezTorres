# 👋 Hello I'm Angel

I'm a student learning Java!
I'm improving day by day and learning new things to be a little better than yesterday.
I enjoy creating programs and testing them.

I'm also learning to program in Unity, but I dedicate more time to Java.
- 👯 I'm a good coworker and I hope we can work together
- ⚡ I like to program my own proyects, and investigate information to improve my skills
